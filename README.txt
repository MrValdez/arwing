For tutorial, I used this: https://pythonprogramming.net/opengl-rotating-cube-example-pyopengl-tutorial

But if you are a beginner on OpenGL, I don't suggest this tutorial. Personally, I learned OpenGL on nehe.gamedev.net and with an OpenGL book (OpenGL Game Programming by Kevin Hawkins). I'm unsure if the NeHe Python translation (http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/context/tutorials/index.html) is a good translation on the original C code that I grew up with.
